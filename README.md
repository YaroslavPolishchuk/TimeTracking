I've got a Test task to create simple web API application that tracks following things:
•  working hours of each employee by projects they were working at 
•  emlpoyees position
Code first approach is used


Stack of technologies:  
NET Core
EntityFramework Core
MSSQL
also I used swagger and serilog to log exceptions
